Xmountains is a X11 based fractal landscape generator. It generates
random fractal surfaces and displays them in a window. While the
program is running the fractal is continuously extended on the right
and the image is scrolled from left to right to expose the newly
generated area.

This program works best on a colour display. It will work on monochrome
displays but the default parameter values are not optimal for this.


The program breaks down into three sections
1) Fractal generation (calcalt.c random.c crinkle.h) This code should be
   fairly solid, It also contains some algorithmic tricks I had to
   invent (though it is not inconceivable that somebody else has also
   thought of them)
2) Image rendering & main program (artist.c global.c scroll.c global.h
   paint.h) This code is a bit more sloppy but seems to work OK.
3) The X interface (X_graphics.c) The X interface was retro-fitted to an
   earlier version of the program that was designed to use memory mapped
   video hardware. As a result this code is a little crude. A more 
   experienced X hacker could do better but ...

PROBLEMS
 All parameters are set on the command line.
 The choice of colours looks strange on some hardware.

CHANGES from V1.2
1) program now sleeps after a scroll rather than once per column.
2) added a -B flag to control the number of colours needed.
3) added a -q flag that clears the root window when the program exits.

CHANGES from V1.1
Several changes including:
1) There is now a secondary (vertical) light source to add some detail to 
the shadows. 
2) There is a -Z flag to reduce the CPU load, once the initial screen has
been generated the program will call sleep once for each column of
pixels. 
3) Xmountains creates a pixmap containing the current state of the image.
This is now installed as the background pixmap of the window. This means
that root-window images will remain in place if the program is stopped.
The -E flag disables this feature and explicitly traps expose events
instead. There may be some delay in repainting the window if both the -E
and -Z flags are used at the same time.
